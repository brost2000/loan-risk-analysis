# Loan Risk Analysis Project

This project explores a synthetic loan dataset to examine borrower characteristics and how they relate to default risk. I use basic Python tools to clean the data, visualize trends, and draw conclusions relevant to credit analysis.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Default rates are higher for lower-income brackets.
- Medical and personal loans showed the highest default ratios.
- Interest rates tended to increase with loan amount and credit grade.
